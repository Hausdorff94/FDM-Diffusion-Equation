Functions for solving a 1D diffusion equations of simplest types
(constant coefficient, no source term):

      u_t = a*u_xx on (0,L)

with boundary conditions u=0 on x=0,L, for t in (0,T].
Initial condition: u(x,0)=I(x).

The following naming convention of variables are used.

===== ==========================================================
Name  Description
===== ==========================================================
Nx    The total number of mesh cells; mesh points are numbered
      from 0 to Nx.
F     The dimensionless number a*dt/dx**2, which implicitly
      specifies the time step.
T     The stop time for the simulation.
I     Initial condition (Python function of x).
a     Variable coefficient (constant).
L     Length of the domain ([0,L]).
x     Mesh points in space.
t     Mesh points in time.
n     Index counter in time.
u     Unknown at current/new time level.
u_n   u at the previous time level.
dx    Constant mesh spacing in x.
dt    Constant mesh spacing in t.
===== ==========================================================

user_action is a function of (u, x, t, n), u[i] is the solution at
spatial mesh point x[i] at time t[n], where the calling code
can add visualization, error computations, data analysis,
store solutions, etc.
